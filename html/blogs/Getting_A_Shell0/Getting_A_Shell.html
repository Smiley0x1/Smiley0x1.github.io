					<h2>Getting a Shell 0x0</h2>
					<p>By Logan Smylie | Published on May 10, 2023</p>
					</div>
					<p>A couple of weeks ago, I had found a router at goodwill. I had very little knowledge of hardware hacking up to this point. I had only once glanced over a guide of getting a shell on a router at Defcon last year. So, as the hackerboi that I am, I decided that I was going to learn. I picked up some soldering stuff, a fan for the fumes (safety first), some headers, and a TTL to USB. One of the things that I remeber from Defcon is that the majority of routers/modems use UART, which is the way that the manufacturers could debug and update firmware, as well as our entrance to the device.<br>I started off by identifying on the board where the UART is, it can be identified by a couple of distinct left alone holes in the board. It is also sometimes marked with RX and TX. I then soldered the headers and connected them to my serial device. Then I launched up PUTTY and attempted a couple different baud rates, but I couldn't figure it out. So I will be studying up on UART, Serialling, and I2C. I should release the next part of this next week (or whenever I have the time)<br>I will need to do more research which is why this project has been broken into multiple parts. <br>Will I succeed in my mission? Will I fail? Will the router blow up and make me very sad? Stay tuned and we'll see!</p>
